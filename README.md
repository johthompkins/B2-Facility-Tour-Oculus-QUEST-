# NASA-Facility-Tour-Oculus-QUEST-

B2 tour is a virtual self-guided tour that allows you to fly and walk around the facility. This is a​  drop tower that was modeled after one of our on site facilities at the Sandusky, OH center. We are​  Able to add models, data, and animations to this sandbox tour to simulation real test within the facility.​
